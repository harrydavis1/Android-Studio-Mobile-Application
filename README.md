Mmonitor is an android application designed on android studio that can use mapping api to track users emotions on a day to day basis. This application is important since mental health problems have been on the rise due to a range of different reasons and the organisation hope that this application can help sufferers of these problems start to track the causes of the problems and can then make changes in there lives to hopefully experience less of these problems. The organisation also wants to help sufferers of anger problems as from a poll conducted by boiling point report a third of participant say they have a close friend or family who has anger problems, also Britain alone has 80.4% of drivers claiming to have road rage which increases stress in the body causing many more complications, so this app is designed in a way to help these people to track their anger sources and possibly find a way to stay away from these sources. The impact on the organisation is that the application will help a range of people suffering from a range of problems in different ways in the hope that tracking these feelings can give users a way to find the source of the problems and also a way to focus on avoiding these sources.
